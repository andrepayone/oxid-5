If you updating from version 2.x or higher:
1. Deactivate the "PAYONE Payment for Oxid eShop"
2. Copy the content of "copy this" into your shop root-folder (where config.inc.php lies).
3. Activate the "PAYONE Payment for Oxid eShop"

### Notice
When you are using the creditcard iframe payment-method there is no transaction-id ( txid ) at the moment
where the order is created. The transaction-id will be filled in seconds later, when the first
"TransactionStatus" from Payone comes in. So when using pixi or another ERP where the transaction-id
is needed, make sure to export the order only when the transaction-id is already there.
